# KU-HSD
Application Code for the 2023 KU HSD

***

This repository is my submission for the 2023 KU High School Design Competition, which ended up placing first in the Computer Science division. 

<br />

Problem Statement:
> Using a programming language(s) of your choice, design a piece of software to help a student manage their busy schedule.

<br />

The assignment center I designed features the ability to add, remove, and edit assignments with titles, descriptions, due dates, and current statuses. All of these assignments were associated with a given user account, which was accessible through a login screen with unique usernames and passwords. Additionally, all of this data was made available through an API hosted on a web server.

On the day of the competition, competitors were given a choice of features to implement within an hour for extra bonus points. Going with the most difficult option, I successfully programmed an option for users to scrape through their email accounts every 5 minutes and add new assignments when receiving certain email content.
